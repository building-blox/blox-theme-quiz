## Terminology

### Schema

A "Schemas" is used to represent what content types (or "models") in the CMS will look like, for example, an "Article" or an "Event" are common content types for posts, and "Home" and "Contact" are common for pages.

### Content

"Content" is represented by "items" for a particlur content type.

## Architecture

ThemerCMS uses a use-case based approach to building CMS websites, and within that a component-based approach.

### Use-case based architecture

In order to closely align the build with client and user requirements, all site pages and components must comply to particular use-cases.

The ThemerCMS use-case based architecture looks like this:

- use-case
    - page(s)
        - partial(s)
        - component(s)
    - component(s)

Only the pages and modules specific to a use-case will be built and used within a ThemerCMS site, and similarly with the CMS schemas and content.

### Content management architecture

In order to implement a component-based content management architecture, schemas and content must be specified at component level.
